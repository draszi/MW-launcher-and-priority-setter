# MW-launcher-and-priority-setter

Made this quick application because I was sick of having to manually set priority for Modern Warfare to "Above Normal" everytime I started it up.

Things you will need to configure;

1. Change file locations in .bat file
 i. Change file path of Modern Warfare.exe
 ii. Change file path of priority setter and make sure to set it to the name of the priority you wish to have ie..

      Above Normal => priority-setter-AN.exe
      Normal => priority-setter-N.exe
